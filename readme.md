# APA Template
I've developed this Word template to make it easier to prepare journal articles
that require subission in Word format and APA style.
It's a work in progress and I may add additional styles and features over time.

* Heading 1
* Heading 2
* Body Text
* Insert Table/Figure Here
* Reference


# Analysis Notes
The analysis notes template is a word template that I use for running
preliminary analyses.

The main styles are

* Heading 1: For broad sections of analysis
* Heading 2: For questions and sections of analysis
* Body text: for commentary
